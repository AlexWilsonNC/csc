            <br>
            <p>The 2022 State Championships took place on July 31st, 2022. Spanning from January through June, more than 300 players
                competed in more than 90 events across the Carolinas, fighting for a invitation to the State
                Championships. The Top 32 players with the most points by the end of June earned an Invitation, plus
                the four players that attended the most events throughout the season. The series wrapped up with a Last Chance Qualifier the day prior to States. The
                Top 4 finishers of the LCQ earned a last minute spot to compete in States the next day! You can view the "Results" page to see which players made it through and what decks were played!</p>
